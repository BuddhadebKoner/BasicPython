#### Class and Instance Explanation    
    Class Definitions:
        You define two classes: Animal and Dog.
        Animal serves as the parent class, and Dog is the child class inheriting from Animal.

    Constructor Initialization:
        When you create an instance of Dog with my_dog = Dog("Buddy"), it calls the __init__ method of the Animal class due to inheritance.
        In the Animal class __init__ method, the name attribute is initialized with the value passed during object creation. In this case, it's "Buddy".

    Instance Creation:
        An instance of the Dog class named my_dog is created, and the __init__ method of the Animal class is called with the name "Buddy". This sets the name attribute of my_dog to "Buddy".

    Method Call:
        You call the display() method on the my_dog instance (my_dog.display()).
        Inside the display() method, it prints "My name is" followed by the value of self.name, which is "Buddy".

Let's represent this in a simple diagram:

lua

                   +-----------+
                   |  Animal   |
                   +-----------+
                         |
                   +-----------+
                   |   Dog     |
                   +-----------+
                         |
                   +-----------+
                   |  display  |
                   +-----------+
                         |
                   +-----------+
                   |   name    |
                   +-----------+



- The `name` attribute is initialized within the `__init__` method of the `Animal` class.
- The `Dog` class inherits the `name` attribute from the `Animal` class.
- The `display()` method in the `Dog` class utilizes the `name` attribute to print the dog's name.

When you create an instance of `Dog` with the name "Buddy" and call the `display()` method, it correctly prints "My name is Buddy" because the `name` attribute has been set during object creation.
